# Arkanoid game Typescript

Arkanoid is a classic video game. This is a little replica of that game.
It is done with Typescript and bundled with Parcel for learning purposes.

Deploy on github-pages -> https://cbh6.github.io/arkanoid-game-typescript/

I followed this FreeCodeCamp mini-course https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/build-an-arkenoid-game-in-typescript-tutorial/

The complete video of the tutorial is also on youtube. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bejSTim38A
